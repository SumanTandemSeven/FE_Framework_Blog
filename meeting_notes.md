## Meeting 1 notes:
  + Topic: What's the right architecture for experience (mobile, native, hybrid app)
  + Who: CIO, CTO, Chief Architect, head front-end dev
  + Native vs hybrid vs adaptive FE frameworks - What's the best approach?
  + Native applications have their place. If your organization is complex
    and has a fully staffed IT group, that helps (list other
    characteristics where native qualifies)
  + Hybrid applications such as React native have changed the decision
    process for selecting a technology approach for delivering
    multi-channel applications. Angular, language like Swift, reduce the
    compromise for mlti-channel approach.
  + Why go with hybrid applications
    - speed to market
    - cost-saving benefit for the client
    - adoption to feedback
    - flexible architecture
    - leverage in-house experience
    - as js matures, you can build full-fledged applications
  + How you can get started to make sure you see the efficiencies when
    developing for desktop and mobile
  + _List steps, provide example_
  + Things to factor in the decision making:
    - Does it need access sto GPS?
    - Is it more data centric?
    - Are the existing backend restful?
  + What's T7's perspective?
  + React native has changed the decision process for selecting
    a technology approach for delivering multi-channel applications.
  + Angular, Swift, reduce the compromise for multi-channel approach. How
    we would help them.
  + What we can or can't do with js-based framework, responsive app, etc.
  + How you can get started to make sure you see the efficiencies when
    developing for desktop & mobile
  + Example of clints
